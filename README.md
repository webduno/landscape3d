comunity building game



i just made this multiplatform 3d game
with a collaborative multiplayer mode
in just a few days using the new vibe coding strategy

first download cursor or any ai code editor
to use it complete for free, you can also add an openrouter connection
inside the cursor api key settings

now, well start with a basic nextjs template
running this command
once it installs everything, open the folder inside the code editor
and start prompting for changes
