comunity building game






# part 1

steps

- download cursor or any ai code editor
- set up openrouter connection (optional)
- create nextjs project using template or command
- run development server and enable ai agent
- clean up landing page boilerplate
- add title and generate code with comments
- create menu buttons
- move menu to separate component
- add styling using ai pattern recognition
- create route endpoint for player identification

## script 

i just made this multiplatform 3d game
with a collaborative multiplayer mode
in just a few days using the new vibe coding strategy

first download cursor or any ai code editor
you can also add an openrouter connection, to use it complete for free

now, well start with a basic nextjs template, which you can download here
https://github.com/webduno/create-next-app-15.2.4/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
or by running this command  which i always use, 
npx create-next-app@15.2.4 webgame0 --ts --app --src-dir --no-tailwind --eslint --import-alias "@/*"  --turbopack
both the link and command will be in the description

once the download is finished
open the folder in the editor and run the developmnet server
in order to show the ai inside the code editor press ctrl+L
now select agent
great, you can now start prompting for changes 

my style of prompting is small and incremental
instead of one big task of like creating a whole game,
because the ai may get stuck on trying to many things at once without testing

so, as a first task we'll delete all of the boiler plate inside the landing page
with a promp like this one, let the ai agent run for a moment,
lets validate that it did work, and then click accept for each file
or just accept all
<!-- then add a title and you can also generate code with comments -->
another way of generating code is with comments on the actual file
so lets make a couple of buttons
and finally tell the ai to move all this to a new component

ok, for styling
we can generate a lot of classes by adding just one,
and letting the ai underestand the pattern
like in this example
or telling it directly to add styles to a page
like we did here

now that we have a menu screen ready, well start with some logic
since we'll identify players by their ip at first,
lets generate an route endpoint file for it









# part 2

steps

- add google login button and endpoint
- create simple single and multiplayer pages
- add basic 3d scene
- make the component general so its usable for all
- create specific scene for single page
- if running commands for reorg, you may need to confirm each command
- make scene editable to add new objects
- camera controls
- reorg
- add controls to the new added object, for transforms
- save objects to browser storage

## script

now that we have our basic menu screen, let's add authentication
we'll use google login for this, which is super easy to set up
first, let's create a google project and get our credentials
then we'll add the login button to our menu
and create the necessary endpoint to handle the authentication

next, we'll create two new pages - one for single player and one for multiplayer
we'll start with a basic 3d scene using three.js
this will be our foundation for both modes

to make our code more maintainable, we'll create a reusable scene component
this way we can have different scenes for single and multiplayer
while sharing common functionality

in the single player mode, we'll add some basic objects to the scene
and make it interactive with camera controls
this will let players move around and explore

now comes the fun part - making the scene editable
we'll add controls to create new objects
and transform them in real-time
players can move, rotate, and scale objects
all changes will be saved to the browser's local storage
so they can continue building their world later

let's test each feature as we go
this way we can make sure everything works smoothly
and fix any issues before moving on

remember to keep your changes small and incremental
this makes it easier to track progress and debug
if something doesn't work, we can always go back
and try a different approach
